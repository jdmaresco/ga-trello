## GA Trello Planner Chrome Extension

This is just a super-tiny Chrome extension, making Trello cards the same height in the calendar view. It's nicer to look at; looks more like a schedule.

It's literally just adjusting min-height, and it only works on Trello URLs that have 'wdi' in it.

A little cleaner, a little more predictable for a schedule. That's it.

#### Installation Instructions
- Download the **[latest release](https://github.com/micahbrich/ga-trello/releases)**
- Open up ``chrome://extensions`` in your browser
- Drag-n-drop the ``.crx`` onto the page to install it

That's all you have to do! Nothing too fancy.
